This is the first individual project of DATS 6401 Visualization. By visualizing GDP, population and the spending of military, 
education, and health care, the project aims to observe spending changes and relationships across multiple countries and identify 
possible future trends.

The datasets of this project are from World Bank Open Data. I chosed G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom and 
United States) and BRICS (South Africa, China, India, Russia and Brazil) as observation objects, and visualized the expenditure changes 
of these countries from 2010 to 2015.
