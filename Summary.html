                <h1>About Population</h1>
                <p>China and India have the largest populations, while Canada, South Africa and India lead the growth rate.</p>
                <h1>About GDP</h1>
                <p>The United States has the largest GPD. As developed countries, per capita GDP of G7 is at the same level. 
                    However, GDP in more than half of the countries is declining, while China is growing rapidly.</p>
                <h1>About Education Spending</h1>
                <p>Only the UK's education spending is increasing year by year. Through education per gdp, we can find that South 
                    Africa and Brazil is growing, which shows that although their GPD is declining, their education 
                    spending has not decreased much.</p>
                <h1>About Health Care Spending</h1>
                <p>The total amount of health care expenditure in the United States is far ahead. Other G7 members have similar 
                    health care expenditures per capita. Like GPD, health care spending in China is growing rapidly. Except for 
                    Canada, health care expenditure per GDP of other countries has increased.</p>
                <h1>About Military Spending</h1>
                <p>Military spending in China, India and Russia is growing. However, in terms of military expenditure per GDP, 
                    only Russia is increasing.</p>
                <h1>Forecasting</h1>
                <p>Although education spending in the UK is increasing, from the perspective of changes from 2010 to 2015, 
                    education spending in the UK may slow down or even decline. Although Brazil's GPD has declined, 
                    its education expenditure per GDP may continue to increase</p>
                <p>Except for health spending of China and the U.S. which will continue to grow, the health spending of other countries 
                    may not change much</p>
                <p>Except for Rapidly developing China, other countries will continue to reduce military spending. However, Russia's military 
                    spending per GDP may increase dramatically</p>
                <h1>Overall</h1>
                <p>Due to its rapid development, Spending of China is growing. Other countries are gradually reducing military spending, 
                    and most of them have not changed much in terms of education and health care.</p>
                <p>The health, education, and military expenditure ratios in most countries are around 8: 2: 1. 
                    However, the ratio in Russia is close to 1: 1: 1. The United States is far ahead in all aspects of the 
                    aggregate, but the gap is not an exaggeration in terms of per capita.</p>
